# Noise and Image Artifacts in OCT

work in progress...

## Noise Sources
- **Speckle Noise**: Results from coherent light interference, leading to granular image patterns.
- **Multiple scattering noise**: -> suppress with confocal gating -> Recent developments in optical coherence tomography for imaging the retina https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350946206000541
- **Shot Noise**: Stemming from photon detection randomness.
- **Electronic Noise**:
